# HotelDruid PHP Desktop Setup Guide (consolidated)

The phpdesktop deployment path is now documented in a single place: [README_DEPLOYMENT.md](README_DEPLOYMENT.md).

Use that guide for:
- Building the release ZIP (installer + uninstaller + launcher)
- Installing/updating the desktop app (interactive or silent)
- Uninstalling with optional data/settings removal
- Data locations and how to scale out to Docker (see root README)
